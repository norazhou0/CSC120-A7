Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

House: I overloaded the constructor with default to be without dining room and elevator becuase most houses don't have them. I also overloaded the method moveIn to accept an ArrayList of String as the parameter so students don't need to be added one at a time. 
Library: I overloaded the constructor with a default elevator because libraries are typically accessible. I also overloaded the addTitle and checkOut methods to allow a list of books being added and checked out at once.
Cafe: I overloaded the constructor with default values for ingridients and cups to make it easier to set up a cafe. I also overloaded the method for selling coffee to standardize the process. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The Readme file is helpful for thinking through the differences between overiding and overloading methods and how they are implemented. Keep inheritence features in mind while adding more layers to those classes. I also find examples codes useful as a reference when writing my code.
